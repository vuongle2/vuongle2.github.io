My technical interest is on the range of image and video processing, machine learning and computer vision. I have been recently particularly working with unsupervised video understanding, and spatio-temporal visual reasoning.

I secured a PhD of Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign in 2014.  I was with Amazon in Seattle on Amazon go and Rekognition.

I am currently with the Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute, in Melbourne Australia
